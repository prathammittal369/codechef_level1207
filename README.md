problem statement:-
Watson gives an array A of N integers A1, A2, ..., AN to Sherlock. He wants Sherlock to reorganize the array in a way such that no two adjacent numbers differ by more than 1.

Formally, if reorganized array is B1, B2, ..., BN, then the condition that | Bi - Bi + 1 | ≤ 1, for all 1 ≤ i < N(where |x| denotes the absolute value of x) should be met.

Sherlock is not sure that a solution exists, so he asks you.
